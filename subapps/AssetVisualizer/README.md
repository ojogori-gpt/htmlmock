- **Customizable UI**:
  - Manual input of asset value
  - Editable label text
  - Adjustable font size
  - Customizable pie chart colors
  - Background color selection

## Technologies Used

- **CSS**: Styles the layout and design
- **JavaScript**: Implements animations and dynamic interactions
- **SVG**: Renders and animates the pie chart
